    <h1>USAID Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) Project Evaluation</h1>

    <p>
      The USAID Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) project seeks to reduce deforestation and promote 
      sustainable energy practices in Lusaka, Zambia, by encouraging households to adopt 
      Alternative Technologies and Fuels (ATFs), such as improved cookstoves and renewable 
      energy solutions. This evaluation assessed the project’s implementation processes, 
      focusing on identifying and addressing market barriers and evaluating the design and 
      delivery of social behaviour change and communication (SBCC) interventions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key findings revealed that participatory methods, including workshops (42.9%), meetings 
      (35.7%), and surveys (21.4%), were central to identifying market barriers. Challenges such 
      as limited resources and logistical constraints affected timelines and implementation 
      strategies. To mitigate these, stakeholder engagement and capacity-building initiatives 
      were highlighted as critical solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      SBCC interventions were designed using participatory approaches and delivered primarily 
      through community meetings (70%), with social media (50%) and workshops (40%) playing 
      complementary roles. Despite their overall effectiveness, challenges such as resource 
      constraints and resistance from target audiences were noted, emphasizing the need to address 
      barriers to facilitate broader adoption of ATFs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The findings underscore the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration, robust community 
      engagement, and tailored communication strategies in overcoming barriers to ATF adoption. 
      Insights from this evaluation have implications for future programming, emphasizing integrated 
      approaches that combine market interventions with alternative livelihood strategies to 
      reduce charcoal production sustainably. These lessons provide a foundation for scaling and 
      refining interventions, contributing to Zambia’s environmental conservation and energy 
      transition goals.
