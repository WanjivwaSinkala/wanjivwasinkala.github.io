  <h1>USAID Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) Project Evaluation</h1>

  <p>
    The USAID Alternatives to Charcoal (A2C) project seeks to reduce deforestation and promote 
    sustainable energy practices in Lusaka, Zambia, by encouraging households to adopt 
    Alternative Technologies and Fuels (ATFs), such as improved cookstoves and renewable 
    energy solutions. This evaluation assessed the project’s implementation processes, 
    focusing on identifying and addressing market barriers and evaluating the design and 
    delivery of social behaviour change and communication (SBCC) interventions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key findings revealed that participatory methods, including workshops (42.9%), meetings 
    (35.7%), and surveys (21.4%), were central to identifying market barriers. Challenges such 
    as limited resources and logistical constraints affected timelines and implementation 
    strategies. To mitigate these, stakeholder engagement and capacity-building initiatives 
    were highlighted as critical solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    SBCC interventions were designed using participatory approaches and delivered primarily 
    through community meetings (70%), with social media (50%) and workshops (40%) playing 
    complementary roles. Despite their overall effectiveness, challenges such as resource 
    constraints and resistance from target audiences were noted, emphasizing the need to address 
    barriers to facilitate broader adoption of ATFs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The findings underscore the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration, robust community 
    engagement, and tailored communication strategies in overcoming barriers to ATF adoption. 
    Insights from this evaluation have implications for future programming, emphasizing integrated 
    approaches that combine market interventions with alternative livelihood strategies to 
    reduce charcoal production sustainably. These lessons provide a foundation for scaling and 
    refining interventions, contributing to Zambia’s environmental conservation and energy 
    transition goals.
